Born and raised in northern New York, I was a teenager when I started to teach myself to code and assemble electronics, skills that served me well during my Bachelor's of Computer Science studies at Clarkson University. During my PhD at the University of Minnesota, I studied marine and field robotics, human-robot interaction, and applications of computer vision and machine learning to robotics. Currently, I work for Independent Robotics in Montr√©al, developing autonomous behaviors and interaction software for the AQUA2 AUV and other marine robots. I've been able to secure Independent Robotics over $1 million CAD in government funding for research and development of autonomous robotics for aquaculture.

## Marine and Field Robotics
I work with the Aqua AUV and helped to lead the development of a new AUVs [LoCO](https://loco-auv.github.io/). My work with these AUVs includes software and hardware development, maintanence and upkeep, as well as deployments in numberous water environments.

## Human-Robot Interaction
I study the ways the humans and robots can communicate with one another safely and effectively. Currently, my focus is on HRI for underwater vehicles using gestural languages on both ends. I have also developed other methods for robot-to-human communication, and am developing

## Applications of Computer Vision
Computer vision is a powerful tool for robot perception.  Cameras are cheap, passive sensors that can be fit into most robots.  For this reason, developing intelligent algorithms which take the images and video from these cameras and extract useful information from them is essential.
