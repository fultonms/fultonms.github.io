## I study robotics at the University of Minnesota

I am a PhD candidate in computer science at the University of Minnesota, focusing on robotics. Specifically in my research, I study marine and field robotics, human-robot interaction, applications of computer vision and machine learning, and environmental applications of marine robotics.


### Marine and Field Robotics
I work with the Aqua AUV, and have developed two new AUVs: [LoCO](https://loco-auv.github.io/) and DIVE. My work with these AUVs includes software and hardware development, maintanence and upkeep, as well as deployments in numberous water environments,

### Human-Robot Interaction
I study the ways the humans and robots can communicate with one another safely and effectively. Currently, my focus is on HRI for underwater vehicles using gestural languages on both ends.

### Applications of Computer Vision
Computer vision is a powerful tool for robot perception.  Cameras are cheap, passive sensors that can be fit into most robots.  For this reason, developing intelligent algorithms which take the images and video from these cameras and extract useful information from them is essential.

### Environmental Applications of Marine Robotics
One of the most interesting aspects of marine robotics is its environmental applications.  I have worked on autonomous trash detection, biological observation, invasive species detection, and hope to work on further topics. The AUVs that I have been involved in the development of, LoCO and DIVE, were both designed to be accessible to state and local government level researchers for their study of marine enviornments.
