Welcome to my personal website! Here you will be able to find up-to-date publications, talks, teaching information, and some information about my research in general. Check back here from time to time if you'd like to learn about what I'm doing.  Otherwise, you can check out my github for recent coding projects, my Twitter for recent news and personal opinon, or my Google Scholar/ORCID for another source of research information. If you are interested in contacting me, please DM me on Twitter, or look me up at my current institutional emails.
