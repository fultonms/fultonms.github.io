I'm pleased to announce that my paper "HREyes: Design, Development, and Evaluation of a Novel Method for AUVs to Communicate Information and Gaze Direction", has been accepted for publication at ICRA 2023! While I won't be able to attend due to my impending graduation, I am overjoyed that this paper has been published, particularly given that this was a first attempt at publishing this paper.
