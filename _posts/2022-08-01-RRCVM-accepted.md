I'm excited to announce that my paper with Sadman Sakib Enan on Robot-to-Robot Communication via Motion has been accepted for publication at IROS 2022, in Kyoto. I'm even more excited to announce that it's a finalist for the best paper in Cognitive Robotics!  I won't be attending, but I'm looking forward to the presentation of this paper. Enan developed R2RCVM based on my original implementation of RCVM, and I helped to evaluate his new version by determining that human participants could accurately transcribe gestural conversations between robots.
