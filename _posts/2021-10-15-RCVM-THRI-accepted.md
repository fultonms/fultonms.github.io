I'm happy to announce that my paper with Chelsey Edge and Junaed Sattar on the method of robot body language communication method I created: Robot Communication Via Motion (RCVM) has been accepted for publication in an upcoming issue of ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction! This paper is nearly 40 pages, and was a labor of love: three studies are described in this paper including a very arduous evaluation of the effect of viewpoint, message content, and robot domain on the effectiveness of RCVM and other communication methods. The paper will be available at some time in the future at https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3495245
