I am pleased to announce that, after successfully defending my thesis ["Natural, Robust, and Multi-Modal Human-Robot Interaction For Underwater Robots"](https://michaelscottfulton.com/files/thesis_michael_fulton.pdf) in front of my committee yesterday, I am now Dr. Michael Fulton! My great thanks to everyone who has supported me through my years at the University of Minnesota! I'm beginning work at [Independent Robotics](https://www.independentrobotics.com/) (an underwater robotics company) on Monday!
