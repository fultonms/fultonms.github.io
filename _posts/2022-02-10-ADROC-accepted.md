I'm happy to announce that my paper with Jungseok Hong and Junaed Sattar on the Autonomous Diver-Relative Operator Configuration algorithm (ADROC) has been accepted for publication at ICRA 2022! I'm excited to present this work at ICRA, it describes a novel technique for diver approach by and AUV using only monocular vision. This method includes a rough distance estimation method based on biological priors (diver shoulder width) which has been quite interesting to work with.
