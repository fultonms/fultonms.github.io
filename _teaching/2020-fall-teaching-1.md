In the Fall of 2020, I served as a TA for the graduate level course: CSCI 5551: Introduction to Intelligent Robotic Systems. I helped to run the course website, created, administered, and evaluated a programming-based homework on ROS, and taught a lecture on ROS, the Robot Operation System. It was a challenging semester, due to the new online-learning paradigm necessitated by COVID, but it was rewarding nontheless! It was really fun to teach students about ROS and help them to learn real robot programming skills, even without access to real robots.
